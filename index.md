# Welcome {-}

Contributing to a large open source project like GNU R can be intimidating. This document aims to reduce the technical barriers to contributing and will help you get started on building R, modifying it, and checking that you haven't broken anything.

At the moment, _Contributing_ is written from the perspective of macOS users, but should be helpful to users of all platforms.
